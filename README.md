# Fig2Num: A Tool for Automated Data Extraction from Bar Chart Figures

**Fig2Num** is a MATLAB-based tool designed to automate the extraction of data from bar chart figures, with minimal manual intervention. This tool was developed to facilitate large-scale data conversion for epidemic research, though its application extends to any field requiring precise extraction of numerical data from bar charts.

## Features
- **Automated Data Extraction**: Extracts data from complex bar chart figures, including stacked bar charts with multiple colors.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Minimal user input required, with clear instructions and visual guides.
- **High Accuracy**: Reliable data extraction validated using both simulated datasets and real-world epidemic data.
- **Flexible Output**: Outputs data in a user-friendly format for further analysis and visualization.
- **Visual Validation**: Includes tools for comparing extracted data with original figures to ensure accuracy.
